# smit-feedback
An anonymous feedback system designed exclusively for the students of SMIT (Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology) serves as a valuable platform where students can freely express their opinions, concerns, and suggestions about various aspects of their academic experience. This system allows students to submit feedback without revealing their identity, fostering an environment of open communication and transparency between the student body and the institute. By providing a channel for constructive feedback, the system helps the institution to continuously improve its teaching methods, curriculum, facilities, and overall student support services, ultimately enhancing the quality of education and student satisfaction at SMIT.
